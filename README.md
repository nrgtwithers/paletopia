## Development Log

#### Thursday, December 13th, 2018

We recieved the assignment for project 1. We were assigned groups. Our group is Ian, Nina, and Minoj. The initial repo is set up.


#### Friday, December 14th, 2018

We decided to make a web app where you put in an image and get out a color pallete and a css file using that color pallete. We designed a simple model for our first product that involved local storage. 

4:02PM The program currently takes in a url as an input, makes the call to google vision, gets a response, parses rgb colors from the response and stores them into local storage. 

#### Saturday, December 15th, 2018

Added some example images that can easily be clicked to test the color pallete generator and display. Colors are now displayed under the image. 

#### Monday, December 17th, 2018

Fixed delay. Rearranged layout. Good looking example photos. Some animaton.

#### Tuesday, December 18th, 2018

Improved Layout. Assigned colors with regard to brightness so all generated styles are readable. Fixed responsiveness issue for phones

####Wednesday, December 19th, 2018

Clicking on the palette now displays information about each color. 

####Thursday, December 20th, 2018

Polishing layout, testing, preparing for presentation tomorrow.
